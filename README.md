# java-advanced-backend-core

This project, `java-advanced-backend-core`, is focused on advanced Java backend development, incorporating modern practices and technologies to ensure high-quality, efficient, and scalable Java applications.

## Features

Each of the following topics has its dedicated branch in the repository:

### 1. Java 8 and 9, 10, 11+, LTS (`develop` branch)
Delving into the progressive enhancements and features introduced in Java 8 through Java 11 and beyond, including Long-Term Support (LTS) versions. Key highlights include:
- **Java 8 Features**: Emphasis on Lambdas, the Stream API, and the new Date API for more expressive and efficient coding.
- **Java 9 Features**: Introduction of the Jigsaw project for modularization of applications.
- **Java 10 & 11 Features**: Continuous improvements and additions to the Java language and standard library.

### 2. Advanced Multithreading (`multithreading` branch)
Exploring the depths of concurrency and multithreading in Java to build efficient, scalable, and robust applications. Topics include:
- Fundamentals of Concurrency and the `Java Memory Model`.
- Deep dive into the `Thread API`.
- Synchronization techniques and understanding the `Anatomy` of Synchronization.
- Utilization of concurrency constructs like `Semaphore`, `CountDownLatch`, and `CyclicBarrier`.
- Leveraging `CompletableFutures` and Parallel Streams for asynchronous programming.
- Advanced thread management with `Thread Pools`.
- Effective use of `Atomic variables` and `Lock`s.
- Working with Concurrent Collections for thread-safe data handling.

    - [Java 8 CompletableFuture Tutorial](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/)


### 3. Monitoring and Troubleshooting (`monitoring-troubleshooting` branch)
Guidance on using JVM utilities to monitor and troubleshoot Java applications. 
Addressing common pitfalls in Java programming, 
including memory management issues (like `OutOfMemory errors`) and concurrency problems (such as `deadlocks`).


### Reactive Programming (`reactive-programming` branch)
Diving into the world of reactive programming with React, encompassing:
- Core concepts and implementation using `Project Reactor` and `Spring WebFlux`.
- Building Reactive web applications with Spring Boot.
- Integration with `Spring Reactive Data` for database operations in a reactive context.


### Code Quality (`code-quality` branch)
- `Integration with Sonar Qube`: Ensuring high code quality and adhering to coding standards.
- `CheckStyle Integration`: Enforcing style and formatting guidelines.
- `Static Code Analysis`: Regular analysis to catch vulnerabilities and code smells early.

### Testing Approaches (`testing` branch)
- `TDD (Test-Driven Development)`: Writing tests before code to ensure functionality and design.
- `BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)`: Developing based on system behavior.
- `ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development)`: Ensuring software meets business goals through acceptance testing.
- `Unit Tests`: Testing individual components for correctness.
- `Mocking`: Using mock objects to simulate real components in unit tests.
